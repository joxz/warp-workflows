# warp-workflows

My custom workflows for [Warp Terminal](https://warp.dev)

> Workflows are an easier way to execute and share commands within Warp. They are easily parameterized and searchable by name, description, or command arguments

Mainly for Azure related tasks which i forget and need to look up frequently
